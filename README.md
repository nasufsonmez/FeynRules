**README: Feynman Vertices Calculation at Loop Level**

**Overview**

This notebook utilizes **Mathematica** in combination with the **FeynRules** package to compute Feynman vertices at the loop level for particle physics models. It automates the derivation of interaction vertices, taking into account loop-level corrections, providing researchers with precise vertex calculations in a custom theoretical framework.

**Prerequisites**

Software and Tools:
**Mathematica**: Ensure that Mathematica is installed on your system.
**FeynRules**: A Mathematica package used for deriving Feynman rules in quantum field theories. FeynRules can be downloaded from FeynRules website.

**Automatic Vertex Calculation**: The notebook automates the calculation of Feynman vertices, including one-loop corrections.
**Flexible Model Input**: Users can define their custom Lagrangians and fields to calculate vertices for various particle physics models.
**FeynRules Integration**: The notebook integrates seamlessly with FeynRules, using it to derive the Feynman rules for both tree and loop levels.
